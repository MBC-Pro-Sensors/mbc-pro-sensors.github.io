> **🧩 New to the Ranger 8-Way? Follow the step-by-step interactive tutorial:** [MicroPython](/en/learn/laser8/micropython.html) · [Pybricks blocks](/en/learn/laser8/pybricks-blocks.html). Pick options on the left and watch the code build up on the right; every function has an example, and a simulated sensor lets you try the values.

### Wait 2~4 seconds after power-on

The Ranger 8-Way needs no calibration; plug it in and go. **After power-on, wait 2~4 seconds** for the 8 lasers to get ready; meanwhile everything reads 120 (cm). Start your program with a short wait before reading distances.

| Channel | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |

| Facing | left | left-front 60° | left-front 30° | front | front | right-front 30° | right-front 60° | right |

The table assumes the sensor faces forward with the components up. Put your hand on the robot's left: example 1 should show a **negative** direction. If it shows a positive one, the sensor is mounted the other way, and "turn left" / "turn right" in the examples must be swapped too.
